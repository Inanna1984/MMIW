## 🔍 Why MMIP?

The MMIP crisis affects Indigenous communities across North America. Disproportionate violence, systemic neglect, and lack of media attention have left too many stories untold and too many families without answers. This repository exists to bring awareness, provide resources, and create space for digital remembrance and action.
