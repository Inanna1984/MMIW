# 🌺 MMIP Awareness & Justice

> _"They were loved. They are remembered. They matter."_

This repository is a digital tribute and a call to action for **Missing and Murdered Indigenous People (MMIP)** across North America. It exists to raise awareness, preserve memory, and support justice for the countless Indigenous women, girls, two-spirit, and relatives who have been taken or silenced by violence.

## 💔 Why MMIP?

For generations, Indigenous communities have faced disproportionate rates of violence, systemic neglect, and silence. MMIP is not just a crisis—it is an ongoing injustice rooted in colonization, racism, and disregard for Indigenous sovereignty and life.
